# 🔄 Daily Auto Commit

This repository uses **GitHub Actions** to automatically make a commit every day.  
Use cases include logging, testing CI/CD pipelines, or keeping your contribution graph active.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

Every day at **00:00 UTC**, a GitHub Action workflow runs:

1. **Checks out** the repository.
2. **Appends** the current date and time to `log.txt` (or any file you choose).
3. **Commits** the change with a timestamped commit message.
4. **Pushes** the commit to the repository.
