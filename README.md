# üîÑ Daily Auto Commit

[![Daily Commit](https://github.com/M4THIA5/auto-commit-repository/actions/workflows/daily-commit.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/M4THIA5/auto-commit-repository/actions/workflows/daily-commit.yaml)

This repository uses **GitHub Actions** to automatically make a commit every day.  
Use cases include logging, testing CI/CD pipelines, or keeping your contribution graph active.

## üöÄ How It Works

Every day at **18:00 Paris time (18:00 CET/CEST)**, a GitHub Actions workflow runs:

1. **Checks out** the repository.
2. **Updates** the daily information in `DAILY_INFORMATIONS.md`.
3. **Commits** the change with a timestamped commit message.
4. **Pushes** the commit to the repository.

## ‚öôÔ∏è GitHub Actions Workflow

The workflow file is located at: `.github/workflows/daily-commit.yaml`.

### üîë Adding Secrets: `COMMIT_NAME` & `COMMIT_EMAIL`

To securely provide your commit author information to the workflow, add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. Click on **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**.
3. Click **New repository secret**.
4. Add a secret named `COMMIT_NAME` with your desired commit author name.
5. Add another secret named `COMMIT_EMAIL` with your email address.
6. Save each secret.

These secrets will be available to your workflow and used for commit attribution.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Workflow Manually on GitHub

You can trigger the workflow directly from the GitHub UI:

1. Go to the **Actions** tab of your repository.
2. Select the **Daily Auto Commit** workflow from the list.
3. Click the **"Run workflow"** button.
4. Optionally, choose a branch and provide any required inputs.
5. Click **"Run workflow"** to start the action immediately.

This is useful for testing or making an immediate commit outside the scheduled time.

You can test the workflow locally using [act](https://github.com/nektos/act):

1. **Install `act`** if you haven't already.
2. **Create a `.secrets` file** with your GitHub token:

  ```plaintext
  GITHUB_TOKEN=your_personal_access_token
  COMMIT_NAME=YourName
  COMMIT_EMAIL=you@example.com
  ```

3. **Run the workflow locally:**

  ```sh
  act schedule --secret-file .secrets
  ```

## üí° Use Cases

- Keep your GitHub contribution graph green üå±
- Test CI/CD pipelines on a daily basis
- Keep a running log of days/timestamps
- Trigger downstream workflows automatically
